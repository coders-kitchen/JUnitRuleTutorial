This project is a example of a JUnit @Rule implementation.

It provides, via @DirectorySetup and @FileSetup annotations, the feasibility to generate a specific filestructure.

It is possible to setup a general environment, when using the annotations on testclass level.
It's also possible to setup a specific test environment for single methods.

Both ways are supported via the annotations, mentioned above.
